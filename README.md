## Tools Used

- **[Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/)**: Platform for monitoring and observability with customizable dashboards.

- **[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/)**: Systems monitoring and alerting toolkit, optimized for time-series data.

- **[InfluxDB](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.8/introduction/)**: Time-series database for handling metrics and events with high write and query loads.

- **[Node Exporter](https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/node-exporter/)**: Prometheus exporter for hardware and OS metrics from \*NIX systems.

- **[cAdvisor](https://github.com/google/cadvisor)**: Daemon for monitoring and analyzing resource usage of running containers.

- **[wg-easy](https://github.com/wg-easy/wg-easy)**: Web interface for easy management of a WireGuard VPN server.

- **[Pi-hole](https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole)**: Network-wide ad blocker that acts as a DNS sinkhole to block unwanted content.

- **[Unbound](https://github.com/MatthewVance/unbound-docker-rpi)**: Validating, recursive, caching DNS resolver focused on privacy and security.

- **[Watchtower](https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/)**: Tool for automating Docker container updates, ensuring that running containers are always up-to-date.

## Common Problems

### Docker stats doesn't report memory usage

If you notice that cAdvisor is not reporting memory usage, you can resolve this by enabling memory cgroup in your Raspberry Pi configuration:

1. Open the `/boot/firmware/cmdline.txt` file in a text editor.
2. Add the following parameters to the end of the line:

```bash
cgroup_enable=cpuset cgroup_enable=memory cgroup_memory=1
```

3. Save the file and reboot your Raspberry Pi.

For more details, you can refer to this [GitHub issue comment](https://github.com/docker/for-linux/issues/1112#issuecomment-699512425).

### Bandwidth issues between a WireGuard Peer and a WireGuard server

If you experience bandwidth issues between a WireGuard peer and the WireGuard server, adjusting the MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) can help improve the connection.

1. Change the client's MTU setting to 1200. This can often resolve the issue.
2. If the problem persists, you may need to find the optimal MTU for your specific network conditions. Refer to the following [gist](https://gist.github.com/nitred/f16850ca48c48c79bf422e90ee5b9d95) for detailed instructions on determining the best MTU setting.
