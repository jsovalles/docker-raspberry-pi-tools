## Pre-requisites

### Docker Installation for Raspberry Pi

To install Docker on a Raspberry Pi with a 64-bit operating system, follow the instructions provided in the official Docker documentation:

[Docker Engine Installation for Debian](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/)

### Config Folder Setup

To store configuration data for your containers, create the following folder structure:

```
config/
    npm
    letsencrypt
    wireguard
    home-assistant
```

These directories will serve as local paths for the containerized services' data.

#### Setting Proper Permissions (Optional)

To ensure smooth operation and avoid permission-related issues, assign the correct ownership and permissions to the config/ folder and its subdirectories. Run the following commands:

```bash
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER ./config
sudo chmod -R 755 ./config
```

## Environment Variables

To run this project, you need to define the following environment variables in an `.env` file located in the root directory of your project.

```dotenv

## Nginx Proxy Manager Configuration

Once your Docker container is running, you can access the Nginx Proxy Manager (NPM) admin interface on port **81**. refer to the official [Nginx Proxy Manager guide](https://nginxproxymanager.com/guide/).

### Configuration for .lan Domains

To ensure that `.lan` domains work correctly on your machine, set your DNS resolver to point to your Raspberry Pi (since Pi-hole will be responsible for resolving these domains). Additionally, configure Nginx Proxy Manager as shown below:

<p align="center">
	<img src="images/npm-configuration.png" alt="Nginx Proxy Manager Configuration">
</p>

**Important:** Enable **WebSocket support** for the Home Assistant domain. This is necessary for Home Assistant to function correctly.

### Home Assistant Setup

Follow these steps to configure your Home Assistant container, including support for Nginx proxy `lan` domain and optional integrations.

To enable the Nginx proxy, access the container's bash session `docker exec -it home-assistant bash` and modify the `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
http:
  use_x_forwarded_for: true
  trusted_proxies:
    - 172.30.0.5

# Optional for prometheus container
prometheus:
```

#### Optional: Install HACS
For extra customizations and tools, you can install the Home Assistant Community Store (HACS) on the bash session. Follow the official [HACS installation guide.](https://hacs.xyz/docs/use/download/download/)

## Common Problems

### Docker stats doesn't report memory usage

If you notice that cAdvisor is not reporting memory usage, you can resolve this by enabling memory cgroup in your Raspberry Pi configuration:

1. Open the `/boot/firmware/cmdline.txt` file in a text editor.
2. Add the following parameters to the end of the line:

```bash
cgroup_enable=cpuset cgroup_enable=memory cgroup_memory=1
```

3. Save the file and reboot your Raspberry Pi.

For more details, you can refer to this [GitHub issue comment](https://github.com/docker/for-linux/issues/1112#issuecomment-699512425).

### Bandwidth issues between a WireGuard Peer and a WireGuard server

If you experience bandwidth issues between a WireGuard peer and the WireGuard server, adjusting the MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) can help improve the connection.

1. Change the client's MTU setting to 1200. This can often resolve the issue.
2. If the problem persists, you may need to find the optimal MTU for your specific network conditions. Refer to the following [gist](https://gist.github.com/nitred/f16850ca48c48c79bf422e90ee5b9d95) for detailed instructions on determining the best MTU setting.

## Additional Notes

1. **Environment Variables**: Replace any placeholders in the `.env` file with the actual values relevant to your setup.
2. **Custom Domains**: If you're using custom domains for services like WireGuard, verify that your DNS records are properly configured to point to your server.
3. **Storage Optimization**: To enhance performance and extend the lifespan of your Raspberry Pi’s SD card, consider using an external SSD for Docker data storage.

## Raspberry Pi Docker Error Watcher

This script monitors system logs for a specific Docker error message and automatically reboots the Raspberry Pi when detected.

### Error Condition
The script watches for the following log entry:

```
level=error msg="stream copy error: reading from a closed fifo"
```

### Installation

#### 1. Download the Script

Make the script on this repository executable:

```bash
chmod +x $(PATH_TO_REPOSITORY)/watch_docker_error.sh
```

#### 2. Create a Systemd Service

Create a systemd service file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/docker-watch.service
```

Add the following content:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Watch Docker Logs for Error and Reboot
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=$(PATH_TO_REPOSITORY)/watch_docker_error.sh
Restart=always
User=root

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Save and exit.

#### 3. Enable and Start the Service

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable docker-watch.service
sudo systemctl start docker-watch.service
```

### Testing

#### Manually Simulate the Error

You can test the script by appending the error message to the system logs:

```bash
echo "Mar 08 00:00:47 pihole dockerd[648]: time=\"2025-03-08T00:00:47.845457489-05:00\" level=error msg=\"stream copy error: reading from a closed fifo\"" | sudo tee -a /var/log/syslog
```

If everything is working correctly, the Raspberry Pi should reboot.

#### Check Service Status

To verify if the service is running:

```bash
sudo systemctl status docker-watch.service
```

To view logs:

```bash
journalctl -u docker-watch.service -f
```

### Uninstalling

To disable and remove the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop docker-watch.service
sudo systemctl disable docker-watch.service
sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/docker-watch.service
```

Reload systemd:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```
